# Orcus - Your Personal AI Assistant

Orcus is a Python-based personal AI assistant that can perform various tasks through voice commands. It utilizes speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and several libraries to provide a seamless experience.

## Installation

To get started with Jarvis, you'll need to install a few Python modules. You can do this using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3
pip install speechRecognition
pip install pyaudio
pip install wikipedia
```

## Usage

Once you have the required modules installed, you can import the necessary libraries in your Python script:

```python
import pyttsx3
import datetime
import speech_recognition as sr
import wikipedia
import webbrowser
